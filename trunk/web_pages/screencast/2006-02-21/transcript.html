      <h2><a name="part_1" class="anchor">1. Intro</a></h2>      
        <p>Hello, I'm Brian Skinner. I'm one of the developers of OpenRecord.
        OpenRecord is a software product. It's a free, open source software product, 
        being developed by volunteers at the Dojo Foundation.
        OpenRecord is a wiki engine that you'll be able to use to run wiki sites.</p>

        <p>OpenRecord is similar to conventional wiki software,
        like the MediaWiki engine, which runs the Wikipedia site, 
        and TWiki, which is popular on internal corporate sites, 
        as well and public Internet sites.
        MediaWiki and TWiki are both examples of traditional text-based wiki engines.
        They're geared towards content that's mostly text, like encyclopedia entries.
        In the past decade, over 100 other text-based wiki engines have been developed.</p>

        <p>More recently we've begun to see new wiki engines that are geared 
        toward spreadsheet and database content.  
        Instead of sites with pages of prose,
        these new wikis are designed for sites with charts and graphs, 
        and tables of database records.

        There are dozens of examples of this new sort of wiki software.
        Some products have been around for years, like QuickBase and Sparrow Web.
        Other products are just coming out now, like Dabble DB and JotSpot Tracker.
        OpenRecord falls into this new category of wiki software.</p>

        <p>Today, text-based wiki software is being used for all sorts of different web sites.
        For example, the MediaWiki software is used for the famous Wikipedia site,
        and it's also used on hundreds of other public Internet sites, 
        as well as internal corporate sites and small personal wikis.
 
        We're designing OpenRecord with a wide variety of use cases in mind.
        We'd love to create a large flagship Alamanac site, inspired by the Wikipedia site. 
        Where Wikipedia focuses on encyclopedia entries, 
        we would focus on the sort of quantitative database content 
        that you find in reference books like the World Alamanac and the CIA World Factbook.
        
        We'd also like to see OpenRecord used to make other public wiki sites, 
        private corporate sites, and small personal sites for individuals and clubs.</p>
 
        <p>OpenRecord is still in the early stages of development.
        We're only at about a 0.2 release now,
        but we've already got a lot of features implemented
        and we'll demo some of those for you in the rest of this screencast.</p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h2><a name="part_2" class="anchor">2. Examples</a></h2>
        <p>Here are a few examples of web sites that you could make using OpenRecord.</p>
        
        <p>This first example is a World Almanac site,
        with statistics about the nations and cities of the world,
        like this page about the top-ten largest cities,
        which shows a bar graph of the city sizes.
        
        A site like this could be set up for open,
        world-scale collaboration, like the Wikipedia site.</p>
        
        <p>You could also use OpenRecord for much smaller scale collaboration. 
        
        Here's another example.
        This is the Cole County Little League site.
        It's a site where parents and coaches can keep track of
        of team rosters and upcoming games.
        This page has the team roster for the Uniondale Sluggers,
        with the names and jersey numbers of the kids on the team.</p>
        
        <p>Here's a book club example, 
        where the forest heights book club
        keeps track of what books they've read
        and what books they're planning to read.
        This page just has a couple simple bullet point lists,
        with the titles of books.</p>
        
        <p>This next site is an example of something that might be set 
        up by the volunteers who run a little museum in a small town.
        They could use a site like this as a database to keep 
        historical records about the few thousand items the have on exhibit.</p>
        
        <p>And this last example is a wiki site set up to keep track of 
        open source software projects.
        Here's a page about the Mozilla Firefox software project,
        with information about which open source license it uses
        and what platforms it runs on.</p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h2><a name="part_3" class="anchor">3. Editing</a></h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Patricia.  I'm going to show you what it's like to use an OpenRecord wiki.</p>

        Here's the wiki for the Forest Heights Book Club.
        It's an example of the sort of site that a small book club might set up.</p>
        
        <p>Every OpenRecord site is a database of items and attributes.  
        In this case, the items represent things like Books and Authors.
        
        An OpenRecord site has a navigation bar at the left, 
        with links to the main pages on the site.
        When I made this site, I created pages to keep track of who's in the book club, 
        what books we've read, and what books people have suggested.</p>
        
        <p>The Books page shows a quick summary of what books we've read 
        and what books we're thinking of reading.</p>
        
        <p>The Suggestions page shows more information about each of 
        the books that have been suggested.</p>
        
        <p>Even though OpenRecord is a web app, we want it to feel like a desktop app.  
        We try to provide WYSIWYG, in-place editing.
        For example, to change the name of a page,
        you can click on the name and start typing.
       
        Or you can click on the summary of the page, and "add text here".
        
        Or you can click on any cell in a table, and change the text there.</p>
       
        <p>We're also putting in drag-and-drop editing where-ever it makes sense.
        
        For example, on the nav bar, I can grab the Meetings page and 
        drag it up above Members.
        
        And I can drag one of the columns to change the column order.
        
        And I can drag entries in a table.
        I can move Eric Drexler up to be the author of Engines of Creation,
        and I can move Jane Austen down to be the author of Mansfield Park.</p>
        
        <p>We've also made it easy to create new items.
        To add a new book, I just click in the table and start typing.
        I'll add Bleak House, 
        and Emma, by Jane Austen.
        
        When I entered those lines, OpenRecord made two new items, one for each book,
        and entered those items in the database for this site.
        I didn't have to fill in any form, or click a submit button,
        or get re-directed to any confirmation page.</p>
        
        <p>Creating new items is easy, and we've also made it easy to create new pages.
        I'll just press this "Show Tools" button to get a few more editing tools,
        and then I can press the "New Page" button to get a new page.
        Now I can give the page a title, "Authors",
        and select what sort of items I want to have show up on the page, "Author".</p>
        
        <p>Each page has its own URL, 
        so when I created this page, OpenRecord created a new URL for it.
        I can bookmark the URL in my browser,
        or I can copy the URL and paste it into a mail message to tell a friend about the new page.</p>
        
        <p>Every page has a URL, and every item has its own page, with its own URL.
        I can click on any of these books to go to a detail page about that book.
        
        Here's the detail page for Mansfield Park, showing all the attributes of this book.
        I could bookmark this page, or mail the URL.
        I can also click on any of these cells and change the values, if I want to.</p>
        
        <p>Now let me go to the Meetings page.
        When I made this page, I created two sections.
        The first section has a table showing some details about each meeting of the book club.
        The bottom section has a bar graph of the attendance at the meetings.</p>
        
        <p>Both of these sections are views into the database of items.
        Each of the views are showing the same three items,
        the items representing the book club meetings in October, November, and December.
        If I change an item in one of the views, the change will automatically appear in the other view.
        
        In the table, I'll change the December attendance to 12, 
        and you can see the bar graph update too.</p>
        
        <p>You can add however many sections you want to each page.  
        
        Sections are views into the database, and different sections can show the same items.
        You can also have the same items showing up on different pages.
        For example, the Books page shows the book Emma,
        and the Suggestions page also shows the book Emma.
        
        If I change Emma on either of those pages, the other page will automatically change.
        This is one of the big differences between OpenRecord and a traditional wiki.
        In a traditional wiki, each page is an island. 
        Each page <b>owns</b> the content on that page, 
        and if you delete the page, you'll also delete the content.
        In OpenRecord, the content lives in the database, 
        and each page is just a view into the content.</p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h2><a name="part_4" class="anchor">4. Flexibility</a></h2>
        <p>We want OpenRecord to be more flexible than traditional database tools.
        Instead of enforcing rigid rules, our goal is to let you do whatever you want.
        
        I'll use the Book Club wiki site to show you 
        a few of the ways we try to be flexible.</p>
        
        <p>On this Suggestions page, I've made a table of books.
        The different columns of the table have different data types.
        
        Like other spreadsheets and database tools, 
        OpenRecord knows about different data types, like numbers, dates, and text.
        
        The entries in the "Name" column are just simple text strings.
        The "Pages" column has integer numbers.
        The "Publication Date" column has calendar dates.
        And the "Author" column has links to items that represent authors.
        
        If you enter "1852" in the "Pages" column, we interpret it as a number.
        If you enter "1852" in the Publication Date" column, we interpret it as a Date.</p>
        
        <p>OpenRecord is loosely typed, like a spreadsheet, 
        rather than strongly typed, like a relational database.
        
        What that means is that you're never restricted from entering whatever you want.
        You can put "I don't know" as the publication date for Bleak House, and that's fine.
        You can always put plain text values into any sort of field.
        
        If you type something like "I don't know", 
        OpenRecord gives up on interpreting it as a date, 
        and instead just treats it as a text string.<p>
        
        </p>But in a date field, we do our best to interpret what you type as a date.
        You can type just a year, like 1986, and we'll read it as a date.
        Or you can type "Oct 1986", 
        or "Today",
        or "Oct 12, 1986 9:52 am".<p>
        
        <p>You can also put more than one publication date for a book.
        Bleak House was actually published in instalments, starting in 
        March 1852 and running until Sep 1853.</p>
        
        <p>We never restrict you to only having one value for an attribute. 
        Any attribute of any item is always allowed to have as many values as you want.
        
        For example, some books might have more than one author.
        I'll add "Chris Peterson" as an author for "Engines of Creation".</p>
        
        <p>OpenRecord has simple literal types, like numbers, dates, and text.
        We also have item links, so one item can be related to another.
        For example, in the author column I've added references to author items.
        I could have just used a text string to record the author, 
        but I wanted to create author items so that I could keep track of 
        detailed information about authors as well as books.
        
        I can click on this Jane Austen link and go to a detail page showing more
        information about Jane Austen, like when she lived, and what books she wrote.</p>
        
        <p>We try to make it easy to create item links.
        For example, if I click in the author column, 
        OpenRecord knows that I probably want to create a link to an author item.
        OpenRecord offers me a list of the authors who are already in the database.
        If I type the letter "J", 
        the list narrows down to just the authors with names that start with "J".
        
        If I type in a new name, OpenRecord creates a brand new item for that author
        and creates a link to the new item.</p>
        
        <p>OpenRecord offers both one-way links and bi-directional links.
        On this book club wiki, I've told OpenRecord to connect the
        authors and books using bi-directional links.  
        That means OpenRecord will always keep the authors in sync
        with the books they've authored. 
        
        When I entered Charles Dickens in this table as the author of Bleak House,
        OpenRecord did three things for me:
        it created an item to represent Charles Dickens;
        it set the author attribute of Bleak House to point to Dickens;
        and on the Dickens item, it created a books attribute and set that
        to point back at Bleak House.
        
        So, if I click on the link to Charles Dickens
        I'll see that this item has an entry for Bleak House in the books attribute.</p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h2><a name="part_5" class="anchor">5. Concurrency</a></h2>
        <p>OpenRecord supports concurrent editing by multiple users.
        Several people can edit a page at the same time, and
        one person will never accidentally overwrite another person's changes.
        
        I'll use the Book Club wiki site to show you some
        examples of concurrent editing.</p>
        
        <p>I'm going to use several browser windows, 
        one for each user.
        
        In this first window, I'm logged in as Bill.
        Here's a second window, where I'm logged in as Hillary.
        
        In this demo, Hillary's browser and Bill's browser are both
        running on the same computer, but OpenRecord doesn't know 
        that, and Hillary and Bill could just as easily be thousands
        of miles away from each other, using different browsers on 
        different operating systems.</p>
        
        <p>Hillary and Bill can each add new books to the suggestions page.
        I'll start with Hillary, who adds a couple of books: "Ariel"
        and "Carfree Cities".
        
        And then I'll switch to Bill's window, where I'll add "Atlas Shrugged".
               
        Now I'll bring up a new browser window, for a third user, Al,
        who's just now visiting the same page.
        Al sees all of the books that Hillary and Bill added: 
        Ariel, Atlas Shrugged, and Carfree Cities.</p>
                
        <p>At this point, neither Bill nor Hillary see the new books 
        that the other person added.
        The new additions have been sent to the server and saved in the
        database, but the changes don't show up until the page is reloaded.
        
        Someday OpenRecord might use a polling mechanism 
        or a live subscription mechanism so that the browser client code
        gets notified of new changes on the server.  
        But we haven't got that implemented yet, so for now you only
        see changes when you refresh the page.
        That's how most wikis work today, 
        and in practice that's good enough for what most people need.
        
        If I press the refresh button in Bill's browser,
        Hillary's new changes appear.</p>
        
        <p>Adding new items to a page is one example of concurrent editing.
        Let me show you another example, 
        this time changing the order of the pages in the nav bar.
        Bill will drag the Suggestions page all the way to the top.
        And Hillary will drag the Members page all the way to the bottom.
        
        Now when Al looks at the site, 
        he'll see Suggestions at the top and Members at the bottom.
        OpenRecord accepted both Hillary and Bill's changes,
        and merged them together without letting either user's changes overwrite
        the other user's changes.</p>
        
        <p>I'll show you one more example, 
        this time with two users editing the same value in the same cell of a table.
        In Bill's browser, I'll change the publication date 
        of Mansfield Park from 1814 to December 1814.
        In Hillary's browser, I'll change the same date from 1814
        to January 1815.
        
        When I open the page in Al's browser, I see both of the new dates.  
        It may be that both December 1814 and January 1815 are correct, 
        so the users will leave the page just as it is. 
        Or, one date may be wrong and should be deleted, but OpenRecord has
        no way of knowing that, so OpenRecord just accepts both Bill's changes 
        and Hillary's changes, and lets them sort it out.</p>
        
        <p>OpenRecord requires very little code to handle these sorts of concurrency cases.  
        OpenRecord uses some unconventional data structures for representing 
        items and values, and most of the concurrency handling falls out
        for free as a result of the data structures.
        
        The OpenRecord database structure is inherently well-suited 
        to distributed use.  
        On-line concurrent use is one example of that.
        Another example that we expect to handle well is offline use,
        where a user copies an entire database to a laptop,
        takes it on vacation, makes a bunch of changes,
        and then merges those changes back into the company database 
        once they return from vacation.</p>
        
        <p>OpenRecord should be well suited to this sort of forking and merging of repositories, 
        including more complicated examples with multi-way forks and merges.
        
        The OpenRecord data structures might also work well in a set-up 
        where you have a fault-tolerant peer-to-peer distributed datastore 
        instead of a central server-based datastore.</p>
      <hr/>
      
      <h2><a name="part_6" class="anchor">6. Plugins</a></h2>
        <p>Developers can add to OpenRecord by writing plugin views.
        
        OpenRecord uses plugins to display items on pages.
        OpenRecord has a small set of built-in plugins, 
        and you can also add new ones.
        
        I'll use the Book Club wiki site to show you where we use plugins.</p>
        
        <p>On the book club wiki, the different pages show items in different ways.
        The Books page has a couple of simple bullet-point lists of items.
        The Suggestions page has a table of items.
        The Meetings page has both a table and a bar graph.
        I can click on an item link to go to a detail page,
        and that page shows a detail view of a single item.
        
        All of those different views are implemented as plugins: 
        the table view, the bar graph, the detail view, and the bullet point list.</p>
        
        <p>When you make a page, you can choose which plugin views you want to use.
        You can also change an existing page to use different views.
        
        The Suggestions page shows a list of items using a table view.
        When I click on the "Show Tools" button, 
        I get a menu that lets me see what other plugin views are available.
        I can switch to Outline View,
        or Bar Chart View, 
        or Detail View, where each item is displayed in a separate box.</p>
        
        <p>We've tried to make it pretty easy for programmers to create new plugins.
        
        Here's a simple Plugin Generator page that's included in OpenRecord.
        
        You fill in the name you want for your new plugin class,
        and then press the "Create Plugin" button.</p>
        
        <p>The code generator creates a starter file for you, 
        with a little boilerplate code that all plugins need.
        
        In the generated code, there's a method called "refresh", 
        which the plugin calls whenever it draws itself on the screen.
        The generated file includes some simple example code in the refresh method.  
        I'll delete that generated code, 
        and replace it with a single line that says "Hello World!".</p>
        
        <p>That's all it takes to write a simple plugin.
        To install the plugin, just drop the file into the plugins directory of your
        OpenRecord site.  OpenRecord will automatically find the plugin and install it.
        
        The next time you visit a page on the site, the new plugin will be available.</p>
        
        <p>To make a plugin, you just need to know how to write a little bit of
        JavaScript code that looks at items and attributes and creates 
        corresponding HTML elements in the DOM.  
        You don't need to know anything about any of the underlying infrastructure.
        You don't need to know about client-server communication, 
        or about automatic update notifications,
        or query execution,
        or concurrency,
        or unique IDs.</p>
        
        <p>We're hoping that we've made it easy to create plugins,
        and that as a result developers will write a wide variety of plugin views:
          bar graphs, scatter plots, Gantt charts, pivot tables, timeline views,
          and all sorts of other quantitative visualizations,
          like the ones Edward Tufte highlights in his books.</p>

      <h2><a name="part_7" class="anchor">7. Introspection</a></h2>
        <p>If you're a programmer, 
        you might be interested in looking around inside an OpenRecord database.
        
        You can use normal OpenRecord views for introspection,
        to look into the database and see some of the underlying structures,
        like the structures of the views themselves.</p>
       
        <p>Here's a newly created OpenRecord web site, without any pages.
        It doesn't even have a welcome page, so there's not even a nav bar menu.</p>
        
        <p>I'll create an account for myself, 
        and once I'm logged in I'll press the "Show Tools" button,
        which makes the "New Page" button show up, so I can create a new page.
        
        I'll name this page "Page 1".</p>
        
        <p>Usually, when a user creates a new page, 
        they'll set it up to show normal content items: 
        items that represent things like books, or cities, or baseball players.
        
        But if you want to, 
        you can create introspection pages, 
        which show the items that represent the underlying structures in OpenRecord itself.</p>
        
        <p>In a langauge like Smalltalk, almost everything is an object, 
        including classes and metaclasses.
        
        Similarly, in OpenRecord, almost everything is an item.
        There are items for things like pages, sections, queries, attributes, and categories.</p>
        
        <p>Now that we've created a page in the database, 
        we should be able to ask for a list of the pages, 
        and see our new page in the list.
        
        To do that, I'll create a new section, and I'll call it "Section 1.1"
        Then I'll set up the query to include items whose Category is "Page".
        
        That creates a table which has one row for each page in the database, 
        and which has columns for the different attributes of the item representing the page.</p>
        
        <p>Now I'll create a second section, which I'll call "Section 1.2".
        I'll set up the query to include items whose Category is "Section".
        
        That creates a table which has one row for each section in the database.
        
        Page 1 knows what sections it has, Section 1.1 and Section 1.2.
        
        And each of the Sections knows what page it belongs on.</p>
        
        <p>Now I'll create a second page, "Page 2", 
        with a "Section 2.1", 
        which I'll use to show an Outline View
        that includes items whose Category is "Category".
        
        That creates a list that shows me the ten axiomatic Categories 
        that are built into OpenRecord, before the user starts creating new categories.
        The list includes Categories for things like Pages, Sections, Plugins,
        Attributes, Categories, and Queries.</p>
        
        <p>I can go look at any of these items in more detail.
        Here's the item representing the category called Page.
        There are two items in this category, Page 1 and Page 2.
        I'll go to the detail view for Page 2.
        Since Page 2 is a page, it belongs to the Category called Page.
        Since the category called Page is a category, 
        it belongs to the category called category.
        The Category called Category is itself a category, 
        so that's where it all ends.</p>
