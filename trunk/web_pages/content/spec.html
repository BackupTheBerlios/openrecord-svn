<h1>Product Specification</h1>

<div>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>This feature list describes a hypothetical system designed to facilitate 
  web-based collaboration. This OpenRecord design is inspired by wiki software 
  and sites like Wikipedia, as well as Content Management Systems (CMSs) like 
  Zope/Plone and <a href="http://www.ez.no/" rel="external">eZ publish</a>. The OpenRecord 
  design also draws on ideas from outliners like Lotus Agenda and OmniOutliner,
  spreadsheets like Lotus Improv, and newer work like Chandler and RDF.</p>
  
  <p>OpenRecord is similar to a wiki, but with some database features added in. 
  Wiki systems usually let you organize your content as pages of text, or pages 
  of rich text. In OpenRecord your content is organized as a database of items, 
  or records. Each page on an OpenRecord site can query the database to get some 
  set of items, and those items can be displayed in an editable table, or in an 
  outline format, or in other formats. In time, OpenRecord could grow to 
  incorporate simple spreadsheet features, as well as interactive charting and 
  graphing features, and OLAP and pivot table features.</p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  
  <ol>
    <li class="detail">Enable a workgroup to work in an unusually open and transparent style</li>
    <li class="detail">Facilitate sharing and collaboration</li>
    <li class="detail">Facilitate tracking of goals, tasks, and work accomplished</li>
    <li class="detail">Facilitate comparison and prioritization</li>
    <li class="detail">Facilitate categorization and structuring of content</li>
    <li class="detail">Make it easy to create new content without first planning how the content will be organized</li>
    <li class="detail">Make it easy to gradually add structure and organization to the content.</li>
    <li class="detail">Make it easy to re-organize content in different ways, and have multiple concurrent organization schemes.</li>
    <li class="detail">Discourage the growth of a jumbled jungle of rambling discussion</li>
    <li class="detail">Offer features geared more toward collecting facts and figures, 
    rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-Ed" rel="external"><abbr title="Opinion Editorial">op-ed</abbr></a> content</li>
    <li class="detail">Discourage long pure-text discussion threads (like email or IRC)</li>

  </ol>
  
  <h2>Examples of use cases</h2>
  
  <ol>
    <li class="detail">People can propose new ideas for the workgroup to consider.
    It should be easy to do make a new proposal, perhaps by filling in
    some simple form.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can add little scraps of new information about a
    proposal that was previously suggested. For example, if one person proposes
    that the group lease equipment from a certain vendor, but doesn't give the URL 
    for the vendor's website, another person
    can come along later and fill in the missing information.</li>
    <li class="detail">A site might provide a small database of interesting products,
    or companies, or non-profit organizations.  Each entry could include lots of 
    little details we might want to keep track of, like links to the external
    websites, or the tax id number of the organization.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can add to the list of things to keep track of about
    an organization. For example, somebody might create a new field for keeping track of 
    when each organization was founded, and then other people can fill in the value
    for that field for each new organization, and people can go back and fill
    in that information for previously listed organizations.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can fill out surveys, and the site can gather the
    and display the results.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can create new surveys covering 
    different topics, like what countries the organization operates in, or what
    their affirmative action and employment practices are, or what their
    fundraising practices and organizational overhead rates are.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can create new "scorecards", which give scores to
    different organizations based on the answers to questions on different surveys.
    (Or perhaps some other sort of tools geared toward quantitative evaluation?)</li>
    <li class="detail">People can look at lists of organizations and see how they 
    scored on scorecards.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can contribute to cost-benefit estimates based on 
    knowledge about the work the organizations do.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can see accounting records about how the group
    is using its money.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can see a record of all the email sent and received
    by the project.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can see simple charts and graphs, generated from
    whatever quantitative info we have on record, like the annual budgets of 
    different organizations, or how much money the project spent
    this year compared to the last 2 years.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can disagree with each other, with having to argue
    about it. Two people can have different answers to the same question, and the
    system can record both answers, and show both answers to anybody who asks.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can propose new ideas. People might propose new ways
    of running the site, or new sections the site should include, or a new ways for
    selecting what work to do.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can comment on proposals, and list pros and cons, and 
    add suggested amendments or refinements.</li>
    <li class="detail">People can vote for or against proposals, or somehow rate 
    or rank the proposals.</li>
  </ol>

            for yourself.</li>
            <li class="detail">Exception: it might be fine to let anonymous visitors make
            very minor contributions. For example, we might let people fix small typos,
            or click on checkboxes to place votes or categorize content. But we should

            As a result, all content is publicly available for reuse and repurposing &mdash; content
            is never left in some sort of legal limbo where we don't know who created it
            or how to reach them.</li> 
            <li class="detail">Once you have a login account, you can sign up for a 
            "transparent email account" with an address firstname.lastname@openagenda.org.</li>

            and since then has been changed a dozen times.  By default I should see the
            most recent version of the content, but the version number should be visible with it,
            and there should be a link (or links) that allow me to see the original version
            or any of the intermediate versions. I should also be able to see when each 
            change was made, and who made the change.</li>
          </ul>

        <li class="detail">Navigation bar
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">There should be a nav bar available on every page.</li>
            <li class="detail">From the nav bar, it should be possible to get to every page.</li>
            <li class="detail">It should be possible to expand or collapse parts 
            of the nav bar, to focus on just what you care about and get rid of visual clutter.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Items and attributes
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">When users create content, they're creating items. 
            Every piece of new content is a new item. The back-end data store simply
            stores a big jumble of undifferentiated items.</li>
            <li class="detail">Every item can have a "Name", a "Summary", and a "Body".</li>
            <li class="detail">Users can make up new attributes to add to an item. &mdash; For 
            example, I can add a "Phone number" attribute to the item representing
            Amnesty International.</li>
            <li class="detail">Any attribute can have more than one value. &mdash; For
            example, I can put three different phone numbers into the "phone number" attribute
            for Amnesty International. Or I can put one phone number in the attribute, and you 
            can put a different phone number there without erasing what I put.</li>
            <li class="detail">An attribute can have a suggested data type. &mdash; For
            example, the "Name" attribute would have a suggested data type of "String",
            while a "Annual budget" attribute would have a suggested data type of "Money".
            Any attribute can be assigned any type of value, regardless of what the
            suggested data type is. "Annual budget" may have a suggested data type of "Money",
            but you're still free to put in a string value like "Too little!".</li>
            <li class="detail">Attributes can have a literal values (like numbers, or dates, or
            text strings), and they can also have values that are references to items. For 
            example, the item representing the book "The Hobbit" might have an attribute
            called "Author", which could contain a simple text string like 
            "J.R.R. Tolkien", or which could instead contain a reference to an item
            representing Tolkien. The Tolkien item could have its own attributes, like
            data of birth. All references between items are automatically bi-directional,
            so when you take the item "The Hobbit" and set its "Author" attribute to
            point to the "Tolkien" item, the system automatically sets an inverse attribute
            on the "Tolkien" item to point back to "The Hobbit". You can think of these
            automatic inverse attributes as "of/by/for" attributes  &mdash; "The Hobbit"
            has an "Author" set to "Tolkien", and inversely, "Tolkien" is the "Author of/by/for"
            "The Hobbit". An employee item has a "Department" attribute, and the related
            department item is the "Department of/by/for" that employee.</li>
            <li class="detail">It should be a two-click operation to take any attribute 
            value that's a string literal and turn it into a new item.  If the item
            "The Hobbit" has an "Author" attribute containing the string "J.R.R. Tolkien",
            you should be able to click on "J.R.R. Tolkien" and do some command called
            "make this into an item". The command should create a new item which has
            a "Name" attribute set to "J.R.R. Tolkien", and the "Author" attribute of
            "The Hobbit" should now point to the new item.</li>
            <li class="detail">Each attribute is itself an item, with attributes
            like "Name", "Summary", and "Suggested data type". Users can add other 
            attributes to an attribute item, and put the attribute item in categories, and so on.</li>
            <li class="detail">Every item can have a "Start Date" and "End Date".</li>
            <li class="detail">Every attribute value can have a "Start Date", "End Date", and "Source".</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Items and kinds
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">Items do not inherently have a class or kind.</li>
            <li class="detail">Items can be assigned to kinds. &mdash; For example, I
            can make my Amnesty International item be of the kind "Charity"</li>
            <li class="detail">An item can be assigned to more than one kind.</li>
            <li class="detail">Users can create new kinds.</li>
            <li class="detail">Each kind can have a list of suggested attributes.
            For example, the kind "Book" might have suggested attributes like "Title"
            and "Author". When a user creates a new item of that kind, the entry form  
            for the item will include fields for all the suggested attributes associated with 
            the kind.</li>
            <li class="detail">Users can make up new attributes and add them
            to the list of suggested attributes for a kind.</li>
            <li class="detail">Any item can serve as a kind, and any item can be 
            assigned to be an instance of some kind, or an instance of some any 
            other item. There is no distinction between Classes and Objects, or 
            in our vocabulary, between Kinds and Items. This is a "Prototype-based" 
            system rather than a "Class-based" system. For example, a there could 
            be items like "Dog" and "Cat", which are of kind "Animal". So, you 
            could say that "Dog" and "Cat" are instances of "Animal". "Animal" 
            could have suggested attributes like "hasTail" and "isCarnivore", 
            and "Dog" and "Cat" would have values for those attributes. 
            But then "Fido" and "Snoopy" could be of kind "Dog", so that you 
            could say that "Fido" and "Snoopy" are instances of "Dog", while "Dog" 
            in turn is an instance "Animal". If "Snoopy" is an instance of "Dog", 
            it is therefore an instance of "Animal" as well. "Snoopy" might be 
            also be both a "Dog" and a "Cartoon Character", because we allow
            an item to be assigned to more than one kind.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Items and categories
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">Users can create new categories, and put items
            in categories. &mdash; For example, I can create categories called
            "Fiction" and "Non-fiction", and I can put some books in fiction and
            others in non-fiction. [PENDING: Maybe consider using the term "tag" instead
            of "category", on the theory that it's shorter and less intimidating
            and more likely to give people the sense that an item can have more 
            than one tag? The downside is that "tag" maybe suggests something that's just
            a word, not something that might itself have a description and other attributes.]</li>
            <li class="detail">When a user looks at a category, they can see
            a list of all the items in that category.</li>
            <li class="detail">When a user looks at an item, they can see all
            the categories that item is assigned to.</li>
            <li class="detail">Each category is itself an item, with standard attributes
            like "Name" and "Summary". Users can add other attributes to the item,
            and assign the item to a kind. &mdash; For example, I might create an 
            item called "Kenya", which is of kind "Country". "Country" has suggested 
            attributes like "Population" and "GDP". I can create an item called
            "Africa", which is of kind "Region". I can assign "Kenya" to the 
            "Africa" category.</li>
            <li class="detail">Categories can be structured into a hierarchy. [PENDING: how?]</li>
            <li class="detail">Different users can create their own categorization schemes.
            I might categorize "Atlas Shrugged" as "Good", while you categorize it as
            "Polemic". That's fine. We can look at each other's categorizations if 
            we want to, but we're not forced to.</li>
            <li class="detail"> [PENDING: Is a kind maybe just a sort category that
            categorizes attributes? For example, the "Author" attribute belongs to
            the category "Book". Book is a kind simply because it has some attributes
            that have it assigned as a category?]</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Items and pages
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">There should be a clear and rigidly enforced separation 
            between content and presentation. Content consists of items, attributes,
            categories, and kinds. Presentation consists of pages, layouts, and sections.
            Both the content and the presentation are kept in some form of structured 
            data store, like an XML file tree, or an RDF database, or a relational 
            database, or a Chandler repository.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Editing items
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">When a user edits an existing item, or creates a 
            new item, all the editing is done in some kind of structured form. Each
            attribute of the item is edited in a separate field. The editing UI
            is more like a spreadsheet than word processor &mdash; more like an
            order form than a wiki page.</li>
            <li class="detail">All editing is done "in line", on the same page
            the content is being viewed. Unlike a wiki, you don't have to press 
            an "edit" button, and you don't have to go to a separate page to 
            start editing. To edit, you just click on some text and start typing.
            The tool should have a WYSIWYG feel, like a word processor. To
            play with an example and see how this should feel, check out
            <a href="http://gumption.org/openchart/experiments/book_form/book_form.html" rel="external">the Hobbit, a click-to-edit example page</a>.
            </li>
            <li class="detail">We do not offer any kind of wiki-style mark-up, even
            for items that have large text bodies. Structure is never encoded in
            text. If you want something to appear as a list of bullet points, those
            bullet point line-items are really separate items, not a wiki-style applied to 
            plain text. The UI makes it easy to create a list of items all at once.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Editing layouts
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">In addition to editing content items themselves,
            users can also edit the layout of the pages that contain the items. For example,
            let's say you're looking at a page that has a big table on it, where
            each row in the table has an entry for a Book &mdash; there's one 
            row for "The Hobbit", and another for "The Wisdom of Crowds", and so
            on. Each column of the table is for some attribute, like "Title" or
            "Author". To edit a content item, you could click on "The Hobbit", 
            and type in some different text. But you could also edit the layout of the page itself, 
            rather than an item on the page. For example, you might want to add
            a new column to the table, or change the width of an existing column,
            or change the table to be sorted by "Author" instead of "Title".

            <li class="detail">Sometimes the user will want to save the changes 
            that they make to the page layout, and other times they won't. We
            need to support both types of use, but it may be tricky to know when
            to save and when not to. We could automatically save every layout change,
            but then when I'm just casually poking around a page I might inadvertently 
            mess up the layout that you carefully arranged. Alternatively, we could 
            generally refrain from saving layout changes, and only save them when
            the user explicitly hits a "save layout" button. In either case, we'll
            want to have some way to let the user do a "save as...", or somehow
            "copy" or "clone" the entire page and create a new page showing the same
            content. Both the new page and the old page may continue to show the 
            same content items for years to come, but one might evolve to have a summary-view style
            layout, where the other might be a detail-view that shows all the attributes
            of every content item.</li>
            <li class="detail">It should be easy for a user to grab the URL of the
            page that they're currently looking at, where that URL represents the 
            page exactly as they're current looking at it, with all of the layout
            options set just as they are now. If I'm looking at a page that I've just sorted
            and arranged to show some key point, I should be able to easily send you
            the URL so that you can see what I see. For a great example of this, 
            check out <a href="http://www.klynch.com/apps/flashlinking/index.html#id=1" rel="external">Kevin Lynch's demonstration of Stateful Linking to Rich Internet Applications</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Pages and sections
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">Each page is defined by a page layout. A page layout 
            it just a list of sections that appear on the page. The first section
            appears at the top of the page, the next section below it, and so on. 
            There's nothing fancy with multiple columns or text flowing around images
            or anything like that.</li>
            <li class="detail">What a section looks like depends on two things:
            what items appear in the section, and what type of section it is. Initially,
            we'll probably want to have just a few types of section: probably table
            sections, item detail sections, and outline sections.</li>
            <li class="detail">A table section would just show a simple table of 
            items and their attributes, like the table of books on 
            <a href="http://gumption.org/openchart/experiments/book_form/book_form.html" rel="external">the Hobbit example page</a>.
            Each table section would have a list telling it what attributes should
            appear as column headers, and in what order. The table section would also have
            a list telling it what columns to sort on, and the table section would 
            know how wide each column should be, and so on.</li>
            <li class="detail">An outline section would show a bullet-point list of items,
            arranged in a hierarchy, like the lists on this page.</li>
            <li class="detail">An item detail section would show the attributes
            of a single item, with each item on a separate line. An item detail
            section might show all of the attributes of the item, or might show
            only a subset of the attributes, depending on how the section is 
            configured.</li>
            <li class="detail">Each section has some sort of "content list" that
            determines what items appear in the section. The content list for a
            detail section would simply list a single specific item. The content
            list for a table section might specify "all the Book items in the
            category Fiction".</li>
            <li class="detail">It should be possible to set up a content list so
            that it in effect pre-screens the content to show just the items that 
            you yourself have created. For example, you might want to see the list 
            of all the charities that you have nominated, rather than all the charities 
            that anyone has nominated.</li>
            <li class="detail">Transclusion is a first class feature. A page doesn't 
            "own" the items that appear on it. Items exist in their own right, and
            can appear on lots of different pages at once. An item still exists even
            if it doesn't currently appear on any pages. This is fundamentally different from
            how wikis work, or how word processors work, where the page does own
            all of the content on the page.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Raw item pages
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">Each page has its own URL, and each page may display
            one or more items, depending on what sections the page layout includes.
            Independent of pages their URLs, each item has it's own URL, pointing
            to a raw item page. A raw item page shows item detail information for
            all of the attributes of the item. The attributes of the item can 
            be edited, but unlike with normal pages, on the raw item pages the 
            layout of the page is not editable.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Access permissions
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">There is no access permission model. All items are 
            editable by anyone. Nobody ever "owns" an item or a page.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Clean UI
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">There should be no modal dialog boxes.</li>
            <li class="detail">There should be no menus or dialog boxes to "Save" 
            or "Open" files. All content should be automatically saved.</li>
            <li class="detail">You should be able to do common tasks in just a few 
            clicks. (As we're putting together the software we should keep records
            about how many clicks it takes to do things, and we should work to keep 
            breaking past records. In version 0.1 you could create an item in 2 clicks,
            but in version 0.2 you can create an item in 1 click!)</li>
            <li class="detail">The visual design is simple and clean &mdash; a start page 
            like <a href="http://google.com/" rel="external">Google</a>, 
            not <a href="http://yahoo.com/" rel="external">Yahoo</a> &mdash; 
            colors like <a href="http://plone.org/" rel="external">Plone</a>, 
            not <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/" rel="external">Userland</a></li>
            <li class="detail">We should have undo and redo features. (If we wanted,
            it would be easy to implement a rollback feature that would allow the 
            entire site to be rolled back to some earlier point in time. Or a "window into
            the past" feature, that allows a user to look at the site exactly as 
            it appeared at some earlier date.)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Built-in data structures
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">The software infrastructure should have some kinds of 
            items available as built-in primitives, including:</li>
            <li class="detail">User Account</li>
            <li class="detail">Person &mdash; not necessarily a User</li>
            <li class="detail">Mail message</li>

            <li class="detail">Comment</li>
            <li class="detail">Date &mdash; including Timestamp (with date and time), Date (with no time), and Year (with no month or day)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">User-created data structures
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">It should be possible for end-users to create new kinds of 
            items, and create new items of those kinds, like:</li>
            <li class="detail">Charity</li>
            <li class="detail">Country</li>
            <li class="detail">Proposal</li>

            <li class="detail">Vote/Rating</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Content export and tool migration
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">We should not be "locked in" to a particular software toolset.</li>
            <li class="detail">It should be possible to export the content into 
            simple, standard formats, like XML or comma-delimited text files.</li>
            <li class="detail">Ideally, the content should be automatically exported
            all the time, so that there's always a current version of the export file
            on hand.</li>
            <li class="detail">Five years from now, it should be feasible 
            to port all of the content into some new content management system.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">Names and identity
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">Underneath the covers, each item has a unique
            identifier, but users never see those identifiers.</li>
            <li class="detail">Items can have names, but the names do not serve
            as identifiers.</li>
            <li class="detail">An item does not have to have a name.</li>
            <li class="detail">Names do not have to be unique. A user could 
            create two separate items, each named "The Hobbit".</li>
            <li class="detail">A single item may have more than one name. Different
            users can assign different values to the "Name" attribute, or a single
            user could assign more than one value. A charity might have the name 
            "Doctors Without Borders" and also the name "Medecins Sans Frontieres".</li>
            <li class="detail">Whenever an item has any kind of relationship or 
            interaction with another item, the items keep track of each other based
            on their identifiers, not their names. This is true for everything
            in the system: keeping track of what kind an item is assigned to, 
            what categories an item is in, what attributes an item has, what
            attributes a derivation rule refers to, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="detail">URLs
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">Each piece of content has a unique URL.</li>
            <li class="detail">All URLs are permanent. No URLs ever go stale or 
            result in 404 errors. A URL always addresses the same piece of content
            for its entire life.</li>
            <li class="detail">The URLs should not disclose any information about 
            what software products are serving the content. The URLs should not
            include strings like ".php" or ".asp"</li>
            <li class="detail">The URLs should be as short as possible. Ideally 
            they should all be less than 60 or 80 characters long.</li>
            <li class="detail">The URLs should not include names or descriptions of 
            the content that's available at the URL. For example, URLs should not
            include strings like "Mail", "Money", "People", or "Brian".</li>
            <li class="detail">The URLs should not include any information about
            how the content is organized in the navigation hierarchy, or about 
            how the content is categorized in any taxonomies used on the website.</li>

            <li class="detail">We'd also like to know that it will continue to be free

            <li class="detail">Lastly, we'd like the software we use to end up being
            active supported for years to come. We'd like to use software that has
            a thriving ecosystem of customers and developers and companies offering
            support services. That suggests not trying to cobble something together
            from scratch, unless you're extremely optimistic about the software

            should be automatically posted to the website.</li> 
            <li class="detail">People sending mail to the account will need to 
            know in advance that their messages will be posted publicly, and we 
            need to make sure they're okay with that. As a safety check, we could 
            require that the first line of each message be a consent statement, 
            like "I hereby dedicate the following message to the public domain,
            under the terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication, as
            described on the page http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/".
            If that line is missing, we might automatically bounce the message,

            have content stored in.</li> 
            <li class="detail">We could also think about only accepting plain text
            messages, and automatically bouncing messages sent in rich text or HTML,
            if that makes our lives easier. Or, we could accept HTML mail, but then 
            ignore the formatting info and treat the message as plain text.</li>

        <li class="detail">Derived attributes
          <ul>
            <li class="detail">Users can assign simple derivation rules to attributes.
            For example, for an attribute called "Per capita GDP", I could create
            a derivation rule that says that "Per capita GDP" for this item is 
            equal to "GDP" divided by "Population". </li>
            <li class="detail">The derivation rules may be presented to the user
            as simple text strings like "[Per capita GDP] = [GDP] / [Population]", but
            the derivation rules are not stored as simple text strings. Instead,
            the derivation rules are stored using item pointers for the attribute
            references. If another user changes the name of the "Population" attribute
            to read "Total population", that change will not break the rule, and 
            the next time you view the rule it will appear as "[Per capita GDP] = 
            [GDP] / [Total Population]"</li>
            <li class="detail">A derivation rule will only arrive at an answer
            if the referenced attributes have values that are of compatible types.
            The rule "[Per capita GDP] = [GDP] / [Population]" will work if 
            "GDP" and "Population" have number values, but if one of them has
            a string value, then the rule will quietly give up without raising a fuss.</li>
            <li class="detail">Even attributes without derivation rules can have 
            more than one value, and an attribute with a derivation rule can have
            both a derived value and one or more user-assigned values.</li>
            <li class="detail">A derivation rule might be used to populate an 
            attribute with values retrieved by traversing references to other items.
            For example, for an item that represents a person, I might create a 
            derivation rule like "[Cousins] = [Parents].[Siblings].[Children]",
            to say that a person's cousins is the set of all the children of the 
            siblings of the parent of the person.</li>

  <h2>Staged Implementation Roadmap</h2>

  <p>Should we decide to build our own software infrastructure "from scratch", 
  rather than using an existing product like <a href="http://www.ez.no/" rel="external">eZ publish</a>, we will want to build 
  out in stages. Here's are some initial thoughts about how to sequence the stages.</p>
