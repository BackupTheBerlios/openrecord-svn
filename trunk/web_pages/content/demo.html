  <h1>Demo</h1>
  
  <p>It'll probably be another couple of months until we're far enough
  along to put together a first demo.</p>

  <p>Right now there's not much to see, but you're welcome to look if 
  you'd like. Currently the code <b>only runs in Firefox</b>. 
  If you're using Firefox, here are a couple examples of old demo pages:
  <ul> 
    <li class="detail"><a href="demo/old_2005_04_14/trunk/source/demo_page.html" rel="external">April 14, 2005</a> </li>
    <li class="detail"><a href="demo/old_2005_06_12/trunk/source/demo_page.html" rel="external">June 12, 2005</a> </li>
  </ul>
  
  </p>
    
</div>
