      <dt>Brian Douglas Skinner</dt>
      <dd>I wrote my first computer program a quarter century ago, on a 
      Teletype machine that had no screen and that saved files by punching 
      holes in a paper tape. Over the years things have improved a lot, as 
      computers gained disk drives, and screens, and faster processors.
      In recent years there's been more progress still, with the creation 
      of the internet and the world wide web, which I consider one of the 
      great human achievements, right up there with things like penicillin, 
      and democracy, and Gutenberg's press.  I'm excited about each new 
      advance, and hope to play a small role in helping to move us forward.  
      Currently, I'm happily unemployed, living in San Francisco and working 
      on the OpenRecord project.</dd>

      <dt>Chih-Chao Lam</dt>
      <dd>Having started two venture-backed companies, ShoppingList and ClickOver, 
      Chao is a veteran, beneficiary and casualty of the Internet boom. Chao is 
      curious about why certain innovations catch on and others die by the wayside.
      Chao and Brian first met while working at  
      <a href="http://osafoundation.org/" rel="external">OSAF</a>, and Chao 
      is contributing to the OpenRecord project in his spare time while he
      explores ideas for his next start-up.

      <dt>Mignon Belongie</dt>
      <dd>Mignon is the most recent programmer to join the OpenRecord 
      project.  Mignon went to college at Caltech and did her doctoral work 
      at Cornell, and then went on to do rocket science at NASA's JPL. 
      When she's not working on OpenRecord, Mignon holds down a day job
      at <a href="http://www.digitalpersona.com/" rel="external">DigitalPersona</a>
      in Redwood City.</dd>
