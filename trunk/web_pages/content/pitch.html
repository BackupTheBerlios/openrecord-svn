<h1>Elevator Pitch</h1>

  <p>In the 1980s and 1990s there were a few types of desktop apps that had 
  enormous markets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="detail">word processors -- MS Word, etc.</li>
      <li class="detail">spreadsheets -- 1-2-3, Excel, etc.</li>
      <li class="detail">databases -- FileMaker, Access, Oracle, etc.</li>
    </ul>       

  <p>Today software developers are taking those desktop apps and reinventing 
  them as web-based collaboration tools. So far, developers have focused on 
  the word processor feature set, resulting in wikis and Content Management 
  Systems (CMSs).</p>

  <p>The market is still pretty much wide open for general-purpose web-based 
  collaborative spreadsheet and database software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="detail">word processors --> wikis and CMS systems (100+ products)</li>
      <li class="detail">spreadsheets --> <b>open opportunity</b></li>
      <li class="detail">databases --> <b>open opportunity</b></li>
    </ul>       

  <p>OpenRecord is a product spec for a web-based collaborative database tool. 
  OpenRecord could grow to incorporate simple spreadsheet features, as well as 
  interactive charting and graphing features, and OLAP and pivot table 
  features.</p>

  <p>The OpenRecord design is inspired by wiki software and sites like Wikipedia, 
  as well as CMSs like Zope/Plone and eZ publish. The OpenRecord design also 
  draws on ideas from outliners like Lotus Agenda and OmniOutliner, spreadsheets 
  like Lotus Improv, and newer work like Chandler and RDF.</p>


  <h2>Trends and Drivers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="detail">Broadband adoption
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">We're seeing rapid adoption of broadband in the 
          home, both in the United States and worldwide. Five years ago it 
          was not safe to assume that the user's computer had a continuous, 
          reliable connection to the internet. Today it is safe to assume 
          that hundreds of millions of users have dependable internet access. 
          That means users no longer need to save their own content on the 
          own computers. They can now access their own content just as quickly 
          and reliably when it's saved somewhere on the internet. And there's 
          talk of large-scale public projects to provide entire cities with 
          WiFi or WiMax coverage. Broadband wireless access will become 
          increasingly ubiquitous.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">Cheap computers
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">Five years ago a home computer cost thousands of 
          dollars. Very few people owned more than one. Today a home computer 
          costs $500, and in a few years a computer will cost $100. Soon there 
          will be many people who own more than one computer, and people will 
          frequently have access to the internet through other people's computers, 
          at their friends houses, at the library, or at work. It will become 
          more convenient to have your content stored on the internet than to 
          have it stored on your own computer, because you will always have 
          access to the internet, but you often won't be at your own computer. 
          Additionally, it will become increasingly inconvenient (or impossible) 
          to install desktop apps on all the computers you use. Instead, users 
          will want to use browser-based apps that are always available on any 
          computer.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">Browser-based apps
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">Because of the above trends, we're starting to see 
          widespread adoption of browser-based apps that store content 
          on the internet. Examples include Gmail, Flickr, del.icio.us, and 
          Hotmail.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">Wiki and CMS adoption
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">We're also seeing increasing adoption of wikis and 
          Content Management Systems, and increasing interest in development of 
          commercial-quality wiki software (Jotspot, Wikimedia, etc.). Which 
          suggests that the market would be receptive to an app like OpenRecord.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">DHTML and AJAX adoption
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">There's a recent widespread awakening to the 
          potential of architectures based on DHTML and AJAX. Examples include 
          Google Suggest, Gmail, and Yahoo's Oddpost. Development dollars will 
          start flowing toward AJAX apps. In the next decade old-style browser 
          apps will gradually die off, and AJAX apps will take their place.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">Web-based peer production
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">There's been a recent widespread awakening to the 
          potential of web-based peer production. Examples include Wikipedia and 
          Linux. But, we've only hit the tip of the iceberg. This is a great 
          time to catch the wave, and undertake substantial new web-based peer 
          production projects.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">Continued demand for spreadsheets and databases
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">There are still multi-billion dollar markets for 
          databases and spreadsheets. There will continue to be demand for 
          spreadsheets and databases for decades to come.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>       

  <h2>Technical Specification</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="detail">For more details, see: <a href="spec.html">the 
      OpenRecord spec</a></li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Prototyping and Alpha Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="detail">Brian Skinner has been implementing a prototype of the 
      OpenRecord software. It only runs in Firefox, and right now (mid-March 2005) 
      there still isn't much to see, but if you want to take a peek, visit
      the <a href="demo.html">demo page</a>.</li>
      <li class="detail">As an early alpha-test project, Brian Skinner hopes to 
      build a system that lets people collaborate on figuring out criteria for 
      choosing charities to donate money to. For more on that, see 
      <a href="http://openagenda.org/" rel="external">the openagenda.org site</a></li>
    </ul>       

  <h2>Non-Profit Revenue Models</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="detail">service contracts
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">sales of service contracts to corporate or government customers</li>
          <li class="detail">example: in the 1990's, I think Cygnus Support had stable revenue streams based on support contracts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">donations
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">donations from users</li>
          <li class="detail">example: Wikipedia is run by the non-profit Wikimedia 
          Foundation, which has been funded exclusively through private donations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">foundation grants
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">for example, the Shuttleworth Foundation's Open Source Funding</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="detail">public funding
        <ul>
          <li class="detail">from government R&amp;D grants, or contracts to 
          custom build particular systems that departments need</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul> 

  <h2>Zero-Revenue Models</h2>

    <ul>
      <li class="detail">Another option is to simply not have any revenue source. That sounds crazy, until you look at projects like Linux and Mediawiki, which gained widespread use before having real funding.</li>
      <li class="detail">The real goal is for the project to deliver something that people need, and to be self-sustaining. But perhaps that can be done without money, by relying on volunteers: volunteer programmers, volunteer artists, volunteer translators, etc.</li>
    </ul>
