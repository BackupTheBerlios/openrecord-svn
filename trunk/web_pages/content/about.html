<h1>About the OpenRecord project</h1>
<div>
  <p>The goal of the OpenRecord project is to create open source software.  We're 
  making a web-based collaboration system, somewhat like a wiki. To read 
  about what the software is supposed to do, see the <a href="spec.html">spec page</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
  <p>We started writing code for OpenRecord in February 2005.  In August 
  2005 we made our first real demo documents, and we began giving demos of a
  0.1 release.  In November 2005 we became a project of the Dojo Foundation, 
  and now we're gradually working on porting the OpenRecord over to use more and
  more of the Dojo toolkit.</p>
<h2>Status (as of November 2005)</h2>
  <p>We currently have two programmers working on OpenRecord part time, and we
  hope to have two more programmers joining us in December 2005.  We're working 
  on cleaning up our plugin API, and we hope to have a 0.2 developer release 
  in early 2006 -- once that's in place we can invite people to start writing 
  plugin views.  Later in 2006 we'll commit to a file format, and people will
  be able to start actually saving their data in OpenRecord.</p>
