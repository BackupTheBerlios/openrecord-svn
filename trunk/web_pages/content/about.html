<h1>About the OpenRecord project</h1>
<div>
  <p>The goal of the project is to create an open source software product.  
  The product we're making is a wiki engine, but where most wiki engines are geared
  toward pages of text, OpenRecord is geared toward loosely-structured database content.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="detail">February 2005 -- started writing code</li>
    <li class="detail">August 2005 -- first demo documents, and first real demos</li>
    <li class="detail">November 2005 -- became a project of the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org" rel="external">Dojo Foundation</a></li>
    <li class="detail">February 2006 -- first <a href="screencast.html">screencasts</a></li>
    <li class="detail">2006 -- pick a server side datastore to use</li>
    <li class="detail">2006 -- convert code to use more of the Dojo toolkit</li>
  </ul>       
<h2>Status (as of April 2006)</h2>
  <p>We currently have two programmers working on OpenRecord part time, and we're
  looking for more volunteers.  One of the main things we're doing now is looking at  
  different server-side datastores.  Later this year we hope to commit to a single
  datastore or file format, so people will be able to start actually saving their 
  data in OpenRecord.</p>
