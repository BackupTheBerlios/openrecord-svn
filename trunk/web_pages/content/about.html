<h1>About the OpenRecord project</h1>
<div>
  <p>The goal of the project is to create open-source software.  We're 
  making a web-based collaboration system, somewhat like a wiki. To read 
  about what the software is supposed to do, see the <a href="spec.html">spec page</a>.</p>
  <p>We're just getting started, so we don't yet have too much to show you.
  Brian Skinner wrote the original spec in February 2005.  Chao Lam and Mignon
  Belongie joined the project soon after, and we've been actively coding 
  for about six months now.</p>
